And then they just filled in the ditch. I hope the ditch realizes it's not its fault Florida Doctor is just Florida Man with some letters after his name. Well, that's what ditches are for. >The first two victims who came forward were 51 and 73 years old, according to a police report obtained by the Naples Daily News. \\n\\nThis is how you know he wasn't friends with Gaetz. It took reading several comments to realize that neither of the ways I originally interpreted this headline is the way the headline is meant to be read. That sorted itself out nicely. \\\"...covered in petrol, on fire\\\" I wish journalists would learn to write.  According to the headline, he raped and drugged patients found dead in ditch, meaning he drugged and raped corpses.  \\n\\nHeadline should be \\u201cFlorida doctor, accused of drugging and raping patients, found dead in ditch\\u201d.  \\n\\nPunctuation makes a difference.  \\u201cLet\\u2019s eat Grandma\\u201d is very different from \\u201cLet\\u2019s eat, Grandma\\u201d. meh i wouldnt investigate this one too hard personally. fuckim Oh no!\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\n&#x200B;\\n\\nAnyway. Ended up exactly where he should be, dead in a ditch. finally, some good news Shouldn't this be in uplifting news? We've got all kinds of sentence construction problems in that headline. Sedating someone at a medical spa seems like a big red flag to me. I'm not a doctor but all of those procedures are electives that should not require knocking someone out. \\n\\nFurthermore those places print money. If this guy was that hard up all he had to do was go out and buy an escort. Zero chance he wasn't making good money. I first thought the patients were found dead. Awkward wording. Why would you throw your life away like that? A doctor probably gets paid well enough to easily hire a prostitute or two. Phrasing. This headline sounds like he's drugging and raping dead patients he found in a ditch. Sounds like it worked itself out Hey, does anyone know when the McRib is back? I\\u2019ve been having a terrible day.  I\\u2019m not sure it\\u2019s okay that I smiled at this guys death but it\\u2019s the nicest thing that\\u2019s happened since this morning so\\u2026hooray\\ud83d\\ude01 Why did he need to drug them if they were already dead in the ditch? Innocent until prove\\u2026 holy murder eyes, batman!! Dude one of the victims was 71!!\\n\\nThis dude was out there raping grandmas. My man looks like the fuckin' Potion Seller Florida. It's always Florida. In other news, OP really needs to try re-writing that headline. Like whenever someone leaves a corpse in the ditch, he goes to town. Seems unnecessary to drug them, though. Rapist Florida Man found dead in ditch.\\n\\nAnyway . . . Huh. Anyway- I just used my Ninja Air Fryer to cook up some amazing sole almondine. Looks like the trash took itself out. Reasonable death. No need to investigate any further. If more of this trash ends up this way I think everyone would be fine. Looks like crowder. Sounds like him too Salata's death is not believed to be suspicious.\\n\\nHe killed himself. I didn't even know he was sick That's the best news all day I like cats do y\\u2019all like cats? He got what he deserved. Let him be a cautionary warning to other creepy dudes. *looks at the very obvious murder* Definitely a suicide. Nothing to see here folks, just a suicide and defo not karma Couldn\\u2019t have happened to a nicer guy. He raped patients found dead in a ditch? He took advantage of the situation to satisfy his fetish? Now hopefully the victims go after his estate in civil cases. Nothing suspicious here. He raped people and they killed him. Makes sense to me Hopefully with a knot on his head and a load in his ass. That headline kept escalating...\\n\\nUntil the ditch. Good. I'm sure Satan will have a lot of work for him Unpopular opinion:  vigilante justice is not really justice.  Don\\u2019t get me wrong, I would have had similar thoughts about doing away with this guy had he harmed a relative.  However, he did not receive due process and a trial.  \\nThat\\u2019s one of (many) things that separates a (floundering) democracy vs. a regime like Putins. If I was suicidal(not), I would shoot myself from behind the head kneeling down with a balloon attached to the gun. So it would look like I got executed lol I mean, you have to kinda expect a piece of shit like this would get a \\u201cCome to Jesus\\u201d talk.  Sucks that the rest of his victims don\\u2019t get closure. Killing is bad, period... But who would trust a doctor that looks like that? could be suicide..or as he practiced in an upscale wealthy area, he no doubt had some very upscale wealthy clients in his cosmetic surgery practice. Whoa . I suppose the streets got em first Just a nice way of saying obvious suicide. Sheriff Ed Tom: It sounded like these old boys died of natural causes. \\n\\nDeputy Wendell: How's that, Sheriff? \\n\\nSheriff Ed Tom: Natural to the line of work they was in. \\n\\nDeputy Wendell: Yes sir. Everybody upon hearing of his death: \\\"Oh No!  Anyways...\\\" And that is why I have decided to kill myself, cut my body into pieces, and dispose of them in the trash... In so far as they know somebody murdered the shit out of him and therefor it's no real mystery. Meaning. Some family member took care of it. Oh well. Coffee break. You, uhhh, buried the lead there\\u2026.\\n\\n> That's where Salata was reportedly found in a ditch with a gunshot wound to his head, the news outlet reports, citing an incident report from the sheriff\\u2019s office.\\n\\n>!Salata's death is not believed to be suspicious. Maybe he committed \\\"Hara Kiri\\\". Yeah strange they simply said it was a gunshot to the head. Self inflicted gunshots are pretty tell tale, so why not say that? Maybe someone got him and police wrote it off. Guess we will never know Must be the multiple gunshots to back of head that make it sound like an accident. I wonder if he was compromised somehow and was actually letting others do the raping. So they killed him when things went south. Trash took itself out. Wish it happened more often. That's Dr. Rapist to you, he didn't spend 8 years in school to be called Mr. Rapist! Florida, MD The Everglades giveth, and The Everglades taketh away. I'm confused. Are you talking about Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz who has been credibly accused of sex trafficking - specifically taking a minor across state lines for the purposes of sex? So, that's fun! The only appropriate reaction. books yam cows gaping frighten combative shrill wipe unique domineering ` this message was mass deleted/edited with redact.dev ` Rapists GET OFF on the act of violating people. Consensual encounters just don't do it for them I\\u2019m not a doctor but i know a whole bunch who finance everything and live paycheck to paycheck. But still\\u2026 why? Nitrous oxide is laughing gas right. I thought it was for anxiety, not pain. I'm no doctor though. Plus they said he gave them alcohol. Not blaming the victims but red flags. Yea, I was wondering why the doctor was drugging and raping the dead patients he found in a ditch. See Bill Cosby. Rape is seldom about sex. Rape is about power, not sex.   \\n\\nDoctors gaining a taste for power over their patients and going insane with it isn't unheard of (and I don't just mean sexual assaults). Surgeons in particular and god complexes is practically a meme. Yeah he had a creeper vibe I share your pain. So, do you like the Ninja? Because I'm seriously considering the Instant Vortex 6 quart. No someone one killed him and left him laying where the message would get across. a guy tried that on one of the \\\"murder porn\\\" shows my wife watches in an effort to leave his life insurance to his fam.\\n\\nthey found the balloon and the gun and managed to tie it back to him. I live in an area with heavy heroin problems.  \\\"Died unexpectedly\\\" is code for \\\"heroin overdose.\\\"  It's mainly about courtesy to families.  It's a sad situation.  You need to report the death, but also consider the families. American or Russian suicide? Oh my god,sheriff, we just missed him! My first though exactly If the Medical Examiner hasn't done their job yet it would be irresponsible to report something as if it was fact before it was determined. Should have residue from gun fire on his hand. Um, where did you read that?  the article says \\\"Salata was reportedly found in a ditch with **a** gunshot wound to his head\\\" NGL, seems like a good place for him. \\u201cMr. Rapist was my father.\\u201d Damn you.....that made me laugh more than it should have Is he an analyst too? > specifically taking a minor\\n\\nYes. Gaetz doesn't like women older than 18. The people the doctor abused were older than 50. Matt Gaetz, the well known fucker of children, that Matt Gaetz? Actually thats funny... because Hitler was a mass-murdering fuck head -Eddie Izzard You can have money and be awful with it. Learned that first hand from a former relationship.\\n\\nDifferent types of doctors will make more money than others. For instance, your family health doctors make good money, but not the kind of money a surgeon would make. \\n\\nI don't know the ins and outs of a medical spa but if I understand correctly. Most of their services aren't covered by insurance. It's a cash business and they're very popular in America. Being in Naples, I'd be shocked if this guy wasn't doing great for himself. I'm not too old, but I had an old school dentist when I was a kid. Every filling I got up until 14, I had only ever been given nitrous oxide for the pain. And honestly it worked just fine. Absolutely doesn't take away all the pain.\\n\\nOne time they gave me too much. I remember the doctor came in and was asking me how I was doing. All I could do was laugh. Can't recall if this was the same time or not but I also remember one filling where the doctor and nurse were talking and I couldn't understand a damn word they were saying. So I knew I was on way too much stuff. \\n\\nAlcohol does make sense at a Medical Spa. I've been to one of my client med spas. They easily spent millions building the place. It's an extremely luxurious thing. It's a newer trend to me but they've been around for a long time. If I recall correctly, I'm pretty sure my client has champagne in their spa. People have Botox parties all the time. That was my first thought too. Sometimes being a doctor isn\\u2019t about helping people. So easy. Crispiest tots and fries I have ever made. Brussels sprouts are awesome. Love it. Buying one for my dad this Xmas. It\\u2019s either suicide or overdoses. You mean you live in America. Excellent point Florida?\\n\\nThe specifics are everything. Well, how close is the window he accidentally fell out of? Are there windows or a cup of tea near the body? If no them American clearly. [deleted] Obvious either way \\\"What are we circulatin? Looking for a man who has recently drunk milk?\\\" Don't worry I got him with the door Lol people always forget about this since that's what most news sources do Yup, stating opinions as facts can get you sued, even if it looks obvious. You know someone could put a gun in your hand and pull the trigger right? I believe he was being silly. r/whoosh Damn lead poisoning. It\\u2019s a bitch. Anyway I think we can move on to more important matters Again, I'm confused.  I was of the understanding that in addition to the seventeen year-old girl that Republican Congressman Matt Gaetz paid to have sex with him, there were additional women over the age of eighteen that he paid to have sex with him. I was led to believe that *that* was a crime, too. [deleted] Did you get the numbing shots or just laughing gas? Definitely not an overdose since he had a gunshot in his head Especially Florida. That state is a cryptid You're right and I'd prefer it not get investigated farther either way. Uhhh. The standard for Libel/Slander is \\\"Knowingly malicious\\\" so I don't know if what you just said is true in the USA My bad.  I forgot what subreddit I was in. Ahhhh. The PEDOPHILE Matt Gaetz. I know who you mean now! Where the others that Gaetz raped over 50? Damn. I had not considered that. Makes a hell of a lot of sense. Just the gas. No shot. My new dentist looked stunned. I made him put the needle away. I told him I was good with just the gas. He tried to talk to me and I said no thanks I'm okay. Correct I\\u2019m just saying generally that is the case. The article said he also gave one of the patients alcohol during a procedure. What a sick man. Ah, a bad case of lead poisoning then? That\\u2019s only true for public figures. In this case \\u201creckless disregard\\u201d would suffice. But the plaintiff would also have to prove the article caused injury which I mean idk what that would be or who cares that much about this guy\\u2019s reputation\"\n        ],\n        \"semantic_type\": \"\",\n        \"description\": \"\"\n      }\n    }\n  ]\n}"

More than 2,500 members of the political opposition party have been arrested.</p> \\n<p>The exiled Bangladeshi political analyst Mubashar Hasan said, however, that \\u201cviolent crackdowns on dissent have been the key trademark of Sheikh Hasina\\u2019s government for over a decade\\u201d, including thousands of killings and hundreds of enforced disappearances, allegedly by state forces, and mass incarceration of her critics.</p> \\n<p> He said that amid the growing authoritarianism of Hasina\\u2019s rule, including the past three elections widely documented as rigged, a civilian \\u201coutburst\\u201d had been brewing. \\u201cThese protests are a sign of the struggle between democracy and Hasina\\u2019s move towards complete totalitarianism.

We are seeing a breakdown of the climate of fear and it\\u2019s difficult to see how she will continue with business as usual.\\u201d</p> \\n<p>An uneasy calm descended on Bangladesh after the court ruling on Sunday scaled back the quotas to just 5%. Student leaders temporarily called off all demonstrations, saying they wanted no more bloodshed, and presented Hasina with a set of demands, including an apology and justice for those killed in the violence.</p> \\n<p>But the ultimatum expired on Thursday night with no response from Hasina. Student activists said further action was planned but was hindered because many of the organisers were in hospital or had been detained by police, with some <a href=\\\"https://www.theguardian.com/world/article/2024/jul/23/bangladeshi-students-allege-police-tortured-them-after-protests-crackdown\\\">alleging torture</a>.

Witnesses have alleged that police violence is responsible for a large number of the fatalities.</p> \\n<p>The government has also imposed a communications blackout, with the internet shut down and phone lines widely jammed. At least 70 leaders of the political opposition and several student leaders and activists have also been arrested, accused of stirring up unrest.</p> \\n<p>As the court ruling was given on Sunday, the country remained under a strict indefinite curfew, with people banned from leaving their homes and gathering in any capacity.

Hasina, who has been in office since 2009, has been accused of authoritarianism and rampant corruption and her re-election in January was widely documented as rigged.</p> \\n<p>Mahfuzul Hasan, a protest coordinator from Jahangirnagar University, said they still had several demands that the government must meet before they would call off the demonstrations.</p> \\n<p>\\u201cNow we want justice for the lives lost of our brothers.

Hasan said student groups were also calling for the removal of vice-chancellors of universities where protesters faced violence, and politicians who spread inflammatory remarks about the protesters.</p> \\n<p>He said he was among many student protest leaders who now feared for their safety and were concerned about being \\u201cabducted\\u201d by law enforcement agencies, as has often happened to critics of Hasina\\u2019s government.</p> \\n<p>Hasib Al-Islam, a Dhaka university student and protest coordinator, said he saw the supreme court verdict as positive but said students were waiting to see how Hasina\\u2019s government responded and were demanding that a quota reform bill be passed through parliament.</p> \\n<p>Islam said: \\u201cOur protest against the quota system is already under way, and it will continue until the government issues a executive order in line with our reform demands.\\u201d</p> \\n<p>Among those calling for justice was the family of Abu Sayeed, a final year English student who killed in the protests on Thursday, allegedly by the police. A video of Sayeed being fired at by police during a protest at a university in the city of Rangpur had gone viral on social media before the government shut down the internet. Hospital sources said Sayeed had rubber bullet wounds on his body when he was brought in dead.</p> \\n<p>Sayeed\\u2019s brother Abu Hossain said Sayeed had been the only one in the family to make it to university. \\u201cThe entire family was so proud of him; we had such high hopes for him,\\u201d said Hossain. \\u201cMy parents are in shock; our only hope is lost.\\u201d</p> \\n<p>Hossain said his family stood behind the protesting students and wanted justice for his murder. \\u201cMy brother died for demanding fair rights for every student,\\u201d he said. \\u201cHe died a martyr.

With the private sector diminishing, government jobs have become the most secure and sought-after form of employment yet are heavily restricted, with 50% allocated through quotas.</p> <p>The new ruling on quotas was paused by the supreme court last week, but students said they would continue protesting until they were permanently overturned. Many blocked highways and railways and broke through police barriers to stage demonstrations across the congested capital, Dhaka.</p> <p>On Monday night, the protests turned violent as police and heavily armed members of the Bangladesh Chhatra League (BCL), the student wing of the governing Awami League party, attacked the protesting students.</p> <p>In Dhaka, police fired teargas and charged at the protesters with batons while pro-government groups attacked them with machetes, bamboo rods and hockey sticks, injuring thousands. Paramilitary forces were also deployed across the country.</p> <p>The violence continued to escalate on Tuesday as campuses across the country became battlegrounds, with at least two deaths confirmed by the Guardian.
